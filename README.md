# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. In a version made with React, the game board would be rendered using React components, and the game logic would be implemented using React state and props. Players would take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol (either an "X" or an "O"), and the game would check for a winner or a tie after each move. The game could also have additional features, such as a reset button to start a new game or the ability to choose which symbol to play as.
